The Data-Extraction-and-Text-Analysis as the name suggests, is a text analysis project where I extract text from various links which are in an xlsx file.
The relevant text is extracted from each of the link and is used for analysis across various parameters.

The following are the parameters against which the text obtained is analyzed:
  1.  POSITIVE SCORE
  2.  NEGATIVE SCORE
  3.  POLARITY SCORE
  4.  SUBJECTIVITY SCORE
  5.  AVG SENTENCE LENGTH
  6.  PERCENTAGE OF COMPLEX WORDS
  7.  FOG INDEX
  8.  AVG NUMBER OF WORDS PER SENTENCE
  9.  COMPLEX WORD COUNT
  10. WORD COUNT
  11. SYLLABLE PER WORD
  12. PERSONAL PRONOUNS
  13. AVG WORD LENGTH
